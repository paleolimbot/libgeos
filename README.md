# libgeos

The goal of libgeos is to provide access to the GEOS C API for
high-performance geometry operations within the R package framework.
This package contains a copy of the GEOS sources rather than linking to
the installed GEOS version. This is highly experimental.

## Installation

You can install the development version of libgeos from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/libgeos")
```

## Example

(currently this package does nothing)
